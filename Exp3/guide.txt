Experiment 3: Group Communication using Multicast in Java

📝 Concept Notes:
- Group communication allows a sender to broadcast a message to multiple receivers simultaneously.
- Java supports group messaging via MulticastSocket.
- Useful in collaborative and real-time distributed systems.

⚙️ Setup & Run Instructions:
1. Save your file:
   - CommSimulation.java

2. Compile the Java files:
   javac CommSimulation.java

3. In terminal, run:
   java CommSimulation

📌 You'll see the sender broadcast a message and all receivers display it.

🧠 Summary:
This experiment demonstrates simple group communication using a multicast IP address and port, ideal for sending the same message to multiple nodes in a network.
