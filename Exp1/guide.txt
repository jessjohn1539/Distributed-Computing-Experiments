Experiment 1: Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using Sockets

📝 Notes:
- Low-level communication mechanism.
- You manually send and receive bytes/messages via streams.
- No method calls—just data transfer.
- You must handle message formatting, protocols, and acknowledgments.
- Example: Socket, ServerSocket, InputStream, OutputStream.
👉 Think of it as two programs "talking" over a walkie-talkie using raw messages.

⚙️ Setup & Run Instructions:
1. Save your files:
